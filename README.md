# debezium-operator-manifests

## Creating new bundle manifests
Following these steps to generate OLM bundle manifest for new Debezium Operator release.

```bash
# Change the following
export DEBEZIUM_VERSION="X.Y.Z.Final"

# Change the following (should match maven version for desired release)
# (and commit right away)
./scripts/install-olm-bundle.sh -v $DEBEZIUM_VERSION --commit

# Alternatively you can also add bundle from  local file
# ./scripts/install-olm-bundle.sh -i "$BUNDLE_ZIP" -v $DEBEZIUM_VERSION --commit


# Optional if you also wish to build the test catalog later
# Build and push bundle image 
# (defaults to quay.io/debezium/operator-bundle)
./scripts/create-olm-bundle-image.sh -v "$DEBEZIUM_VERSION" --push
```

_Note: After installing the bundle you should review it for any potential problems and adjust accordingly. In case the changes were also committed, ammend any changes to the latest commit._

Now push the changes and open a PR agaisnt the main branch of [manifest repo](https://github.com/debezium/debezium-operator-manifests) and all is done.


## Creating test catalog

_Note: while the script uses these manifests files, the bundles included in the catalog have to be published as container images_

```bash
# Build and push catalog image (assumes bundle images were pushed)
# (defaults to quay.io/debezium/operator-catalog)
./scripts/create-olm-test-catalog.sh \
    -i "$MANIFESTS_REPO_DIR/olm/bundles" \
    -o "$MANIFESTS_REPO_DIR/olm/catalog" \
    --push
```

export DEBEZIUM_VERSION="X.Y.Z.Final"

# Install chart to helm/charts
# (and commit right away)
./scripts/install-helm-chart.sh -v $DEBEZIUM_VERSION --commit
```

_Note: After installing the chart you should review it for any potential problems and adjust accordingly. In case the changes were also committed, ammend any changes to the latest commit._
